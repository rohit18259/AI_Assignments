Create an electives advisory / prediction system in Prolog for BTech or MTech student of
IIITD. It needs to advise a student on what electives to take given the career they want
to pursue and the pre-requisites that they have done.

Advisory system here refers to a system that will take some inputs from the student and
ask further questions to narrow down choices and then suggest to the student the
appropriate electives. Prediction system here refers to a system that will take all inputs
and then suggest to the student a list of choices with some ranking. DO NOT build a
machine learning system here. We need you to write Prolog clauses and show explicit
knowledge representation and reasoning.
