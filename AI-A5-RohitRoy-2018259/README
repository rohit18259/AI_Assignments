You have to build a small natural language interface in Python that will provide inputs to
your electives advisory system developed in Prolog. Make it effective and interesting,
but keep it simple.

The interface.py is a python based natural language interface that takes the user input,
tokenizes it and processes it to find root words and stores it in facts.pl file. The root words in facts.pl
file act as inputs to prolog_code.pl, which is the electives advisory system built in prolog.
