Write a Prolog program to search a road route from any city to any other city using this
data. It should work for both cities that are directly connected (say, Ahmedabad to
Indore) as well as for two cities that are not directly connected (say, Agartala to Hubli).

Now your program should either do option (a) or (b). Each option has two sub-parts and
both sub-parts have to be done in that option; take an input from the user to decide
which sub-part is to be shown.
  a. Show Depth First Search and Best-first search on this data. OR
  b. Show Breadth First Search and A* search on this data.
