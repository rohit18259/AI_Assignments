The dataset (attached as ‘roo-data.csv’) provides anonymized information for graduates
along with their respective scores in various CS subjects. Specifically, the suggested job
role is predicted for every graduate based on the courses they have done.

The task is to make a ML-based prediction system to predict the career for a new
graduate.
